# flask_mongodb_crud
Flask APIs to perform CRUD operations on MongoDB collections

## Objective
- [x] Develop an API that allows storing and retrieving JSON data without a predefined schema
- [x] The data should be persisted in a database
- [x] Your task is to design and implement this API, ensuring it handles basic CRUD operations efficiently and effectively

## Requirements
API Endpoints
- [x] POST /data: Accepts a JSON object and stores it in the database
- [x] GET /data/{id}: Retrieves the JSON object associated with the given ID from the database
- [x] PUT /data/{id}: Updates the existing JSON object with the given ID in the database
- [x] DELETE /data/{id}: Deletes the JSON object with the given ID from the database

## Data Persistence
- [x] Use a database to store the JSON objects
- [x] The data should be stored in a way that allows efficient querying and retrieval
- [x] No predefined schema is required, allowing for flexibility in the JSON objects stored

## Implementation Details
- [x] Use Python as the programming language
- [x] Ensure the API is well-documented, including endpoint descriptions and example requests/responses
- [x] Include error handling for cases like missing data, invalid JSON, and database connection issues
- [x] Only use open sources tools/frameworks/libraries
- [x] Assume Linux Ubuntu as OS if needed
- [x] You are free to make assumptions as long as they are documented separately

## Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for the API endpoints

## Documentation
- [x] Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application
- [ ] Include examples of how to interact with the API

## Evaluation Criteria
- [x] Functionality: The API should perform all the required operations correctly
- [x] Code Quality: Code should be clean, well-structured, and follow best practices
- [x] Error Handling: Proper error handling for various scenarios
- [x] Performance: Efficient data storage and retrieval from the database
- [x] Testing: Comprehensive unit tests covering different aspects of the API
- [ ] Documentation: Clear and concise documentation for setup, usage, and API reference

## Bonus Points
- [x] Authentication: Implement basic authentication for the API
- [x] Provide a Dockerfile for containerizing the application and instructions for deploying it
- [x] Include tests for successful operations and edge cases

## Submission
- [ ] Submit your code as a GitHub repository link and share the link
- [x] Repository should have a codebase and a video showing deployment and interaction with the API

## Timeline
- [ ] Please submit your solution by the end of the day on 12th June 2024
