# flask_mongodb_crud
Flask APIs to perform CRUD operations on MongoDB collections

## Objective
- [ ] Develop an API that allows storing and retrieving JSON data without a predefined schema
- [ ] The data should be persisted in a database
- [ ] Your task is to design and implement this API, ensuring it handles basic CRUD operations efficiently and effectively

## Requirements
API Endpoints
- [ ] POST /data: Accepts a JSON object and stores it in the database
- [ ] GET /data/{id}: Retrieves the JSON object associated with the given ID from the database
- [ ] PUT /data/{id}: Updates the existing JSON object with the given ID in the database
- [ ] DELETE /data/{id}: Deletes the JSON object with the given ID from the database.

## Data Persistence
- [ ] Use a database to store the JSON objects
- [ ] The data should be stored in a way that allows efficient querying and retrieval
- [ ] No predefined schema is required, allowing for flexibility in the JSON objects stored.

## Implementation Details
- [ ] Use Python as the programming language
- [ ] Ensure the API is well-documented, including endpoint descriptions and example requests/responses
- [ ] Include error handling for cases like missing data, invalid JSON, and database connection issues
- [ ] Only use open sources tools/frameworks/libraries
- [ ] Assume Linux Ubuntu as OS if needed.
- [ ] You are free to make assumptions as long as they are documented separately.

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for the API endpoints.

## Documentation
- [ ] Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application
- [ ] Include examples of how to interact with the API

## Evaluation Criteria
- [ ] Functionality: The API should perform all the required operations correctly
- [ ] Code Quality: Code should be clean, well-structured, and follow best practices
- [ ] Error Handling: Proper error handling for various scenarios
- [ ] Performance: Efficient data storage and retrieval from the database
- [ ] Testing: Comprehensive unit tests covering different aspects of the API
- [ ] Documentation: Clear and concise documentation for setup, usage, and API reference.

## Bonus Points
- [ ] Authentication: Implement basic authentication for the API
- [ ] Provide a Dockerfile for containerizing the application and instructions for deploying it
- [ ] Include tests for successful operations and edge cases.

## Submission
- [ ] Submit your code as a GitHub repository link and share the link
- [ ] Repository should have a codebase and a video showing deployment and interaction with the API.

## Timeline
- [ ] Please submit your solution by the end of the day on 12th June 2024
